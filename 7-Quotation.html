  <p>
  When learning HTML, you will notice many semantic tags that give meaning to content. For example, the
  <q>importance of writing meaningful code</q> is often discussed in tutorials. Sometimes we refer to 
  a full quote taken from another source, like:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    HTML semantics help make webpages more understandable to humans and machines. (<cite>MDN Web Docs</cite>)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Even some common terms like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> are written in short form.
  If we want to display text in a right-to-left direction, we can use <bdo dir="rtl">This text will reverse</bdo>.
